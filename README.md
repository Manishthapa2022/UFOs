# UFOs

## Overview of the Project
In this project we have been tasked to create a table to organize UFO data. The table will have in depth analysis of UFO sightings and will allow users to flter data based on certain criteria such as date, city, state, country and shape. The primary coding language used here is Javascript and we will also have to apply our HTML and Bootstrap skills. 

## Results
A webpage was created through which the users can get detailed analysis of the UFO sightings based on various search criterias. Also, the filter button was removed from the initial code.

On the homepage, you can see the all the search options available and the complete table list is populated.

When we input CA in the state box ad press enter, we can only see the list of UFO sightings for that state.

On inputing city name in the city box, we can further dive deep into the data and see the UFO sightings for that pirticular city. We can further narrow down our search by adding more details such as date, shape to get more specific results. 

## Summary

One of the major drawbacks of this website is that there is no drop down input list through which the user can select the item of his choice. For e.g incase the user wants to search UFO sightings for California, he must know the key words used or which cities are in the list. 

In order to imporve the design of the website, the following recommendations can be done:

* A drop down menu can be installed so that the user can choose the specific item. This will make the search page more user friendly. 
* One Clear and One Enter button can be installed beside the search input boxes. By clicking the clear button, we can remove all the inputs from all boxes. This will reduce unecessary efforts from the user. Also, the enter button will ensure two step authentication and allow users to input all the necessary filters before triggering a search. 
* Some visual effects such as links to Maps should also be provided to enhance the visualization aspect of the website and make it more interesting.
